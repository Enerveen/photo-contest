# MSRLâ„–3 Girl Contest 
  
  Frontend part of a photo battle application. The idea is pretty simple: on your screen you have 2 randomly selected from database photos, click on the one, which you like more and so on. Chosen photo gets 1 point, then, on the basis of points, we are forming a leaderboard. As a dataset for this project we used the information of girls of a local lyceum, downloaded using VK API. **[Backend](https://github.com/RSTq1337/battle)** for this project was deloped by [RSTq1337](https://github.com/RSTq1337) using **Java + Spring framework**. As a database for this project we chose **MongoDB**
